  abstract = "This paper presents an overview of the greenhouse gas (GHG)
              emissions scenarios that form the analytical backbone for other
              contributions to this Special Issue. We first describe the
              motivation behind this scenario exercise and introduce the main
              scenario features and characteristics, in both qualitative and
              quantitative terms. Altogether, we analyze three `baseline'
              scenarios of different socio-economic and technological
              developments that are assumed not to include any explicit climate
              policies. We then impose a range of climate stabilization targets
              on these baseline scenarios and analyze in detail the
              feasibility, costs and uncertainties of meeting a range of
              different climate stabilization targets in accordance with
              Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
              Change. The scenarios were developed by the IIASA Integrated
              Assessment Modeling Framework that encompasses detailed
              representations of the principal GHG-emitting sectors---energy,
              industry, agriculture, and forestry. The main analytical findings
              from our analysis focus on the implications of salient
              uncertainties (associated with scenario baselines and
              stabilization targets), on feasibility and costs of climate
              stabilization efforts, and on the choice of appropriate
              portfolios of emissions abatement measures. We further analyze
              individual technological options with regards to their aggregated
              cumulative contribution toward emissions mitigation during the
              21st century as well as their deployment over time. Our results
              illustrate that the energy sector will remain by far the largest
              source of GHG emissions and hence remain the prime target of
              emissions reduction. Ultimately, this may lead to a complete
              restructuring of the global energy system. Climate mitigation
              could also significantly change the relative economics of
              traditional versus new, more climate friendly products and
              services. This is especially the case within the energy system,
              which accounts for the largest share of emissions reductions, but
              it is also the case in the agriculture and forestry sectors,
              where emissions reduction and sink enhancement measures are
              relatively more modest.",

                 increase have generally been based on scenarios that do not
                 include climate policies. Newly developed multigas mitigation
                 scenarios, based on a wide range of modeling approaches and
                 socioeconomic assumptions, now allow the assessment of
                 possible impacts of climate policies on projected warming
                 ranges. This article assesses the atmospheric CO(2)
                 concentrations, radiative forcing, and temperature increase
                 for these new scenarios using two reduced-complexity climate
                 models. These scenarios result in temperature increase of
                 0.5-4.4 degrees C over 1990 levels or 0.3-3.4 degrees C less
                 than the no-policy cases. The range results from differences
                 in the assumed stringency of climate policy and uncertainty in
                 our understanding of the climate system. Notably, an average
                 minimum warming of approximately 1.4 degrees C (with a full
                 range of 0.5-2.8 degrees C) remains for even the most
                 stringent stabilization scenarios analyzed here. This value is
                 substantially above previously estimated committed warming
                 based on climate system inertia alone. The results show that,
                 although ambitious mitigation efforts can significantly reduce
                 global warming, adaptation measures will be needed in addition
                 to mitigation to reduce the impact of the residual warming.",

  abstract  = "AbstractEleven coupled climate--carbon cycle models used a
               common protocol to study the coupling between climate change and
               the carbon cycle. The models were forced by historical emissions
               and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special
               Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions
               of CO2 for the 1850--2100 time period. For each model, two
               simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of
               climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore
               the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth
               rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future
               climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to
               absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction
               of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is
               accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this
               additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme
               models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm.
               The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming
               ranging between 0.1° and 1.5°C.All models simulated a negative
               sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to
               future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on
               the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed
               most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to
               the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction
               of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution
               of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity
               versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no
               consensus emerged among the models.",
